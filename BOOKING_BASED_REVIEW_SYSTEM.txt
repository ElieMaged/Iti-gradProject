BOOKING-BASED REVIEW SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
============================================

This document outlines the implementation of a booking-based review system where only users
who have completed bookings with a specific technician can submit reviews.

OVERVIEW
========
The review system now enforces that users must have completed at least one booking with a
technician before they can submit a review. This ensures that only customers who have actually
used the technician's services can provide feedback.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
===================

1. **Booking Eligibility Check**
   - Checks if user has completed bookings with the specific technician
   - Verifies booking status is 'completed'
   - Prevents duplicate reviews from the same user
   - Real-time eligibility checking on component mount

2. **User Interface Updates**
   - "Add Review" button only shows for eligible users
   - Informative notices for non-eligible users
   - Different messages for logged-out vs. non-eligible users
   - Clear messaging about booking requirements

3. **Security & Validation**
   - Server-side validation of booking eligibility
   - Prevents review submission for non-eligible users
   - Proper error handling and user feedback
   - Maintains data integrity

4. **User Experience**
   - Clear messaging about why users can't review
   - Encourages booking to enable review functionality
   - Maintains existing review display for all users
   - Responsive design with proper styling

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
===================

A user can submit a review for a technician if ALL of the following conditions are met:

1. **User Authentication**: User must be logged in
2. **Completed Booking**: User must have at least one booking with status 'completed'
3. **No Previous Review**: User must not have already reviewed this technician
4. **Matching Technician**: Booking must be for the specific technician being reviewed
