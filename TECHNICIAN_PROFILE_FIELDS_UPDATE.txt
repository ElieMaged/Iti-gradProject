TECHNICIAN PROFILE FIELDS UPDATE
================================

This document summarizes the changes made to the public technician profile page
to remove gender and nationality fields and ensure only fields from the techregister
are displayed.

CHANGES MADE:
============

1. REMOVED FIELDS FROM PUBLIC PROFILE:
   ===================================
   - Removed 'gender' field display
   - Removed 'nationality' field display
   
   These fields were previously displayed in the profile-meta section but are not
   collected during technician registration, so they have been removed from the
   public profile view.

2. UPDATED PROFILE META SECTION:
   =============================
   
   **Before:**
   - location: technician.location
   - gender: technician.gender
   - nationality: technician.nationality  
   - yearsOfExperience: technician.yearsOfExperience
   
   **After:**
   - location: technician.government + technician.district (or fallback to location)
   - yearsOfExperience: technician.experience (or fallback to yearsOfExperience)
   - baseVisitPrice: technician.basePrice (if available)
   - willingToTravel: technician.willingToTravel (if available)

3. ADDED NEW FIELDS FROM TECHPREGISTER:
   ====================================
   
   **Base Visit Price:**
   - Displays the technician's base visit price from their registration
   - Shows in format: "Base Visit Price: [amount] EGP"
   - Only displays if the field is available
   
   **Willing to Travel:**
   - Displays whether the technician is willing to travel
   - Shows as "Yes" or "No" based on the stored value
   - Only displays if the field is available
   
   **Bio/About Section:**
   - Added a new section to display the technician's bio/description
   - Shows the brief description provided during registration
   - Styled with a distinctive border and background
   - Only displays if the bio field is available

4. TRANSLATION UPDATES:
   ====================
   
   **Added to src/i18n.js:**
   - English: 'egp': 'EGP'
   - Arabic: 'egp': 'جنيه مصري'
   - English: 'about': 'About'
   - Arabic: 'about': 'حول'
   
   **Existing translations used:**
   - 'baseVisitPrice': 'Base Visit Price' / 'سعر الزيارة الأساسي'
   - 'willingToTravel': 'Willing to Travel' / 'سعي للسفر'
   - 'yes': 'Yes' / 'نعم'
   - 'no': 'No' / 'لا'

5. STYLING ENHANCEMENTS:
   =====================
   
   **New CSS Classes Added:**
   - .profile-bio: Main container for bio section
   - .profile-bio b: Styling for "About" label
   - .profile-bio p: Styling for bio text content
   
   **Design Features:**
   - Consistent with existing profile styling
   - Uses the same color scheme (#7c6bb0 primary)
   - Left border accent for visual distinction
   - Proper spacing and typography

6. FIELD MAPPING LOGIC:
   ====================
   
   **Location Display Logic:**
   ```javascript
   technician.government && technician.district ? 
     `${technician.government}, ${technician.district}` : 
     (technician.location || $t('technicianNotAvailable'))
   ```
   
   **Experience Display Logic:**
   ```javascript
   technician.experience || technician.yearsOfExperience || $t('noExperienceInfo')
   ```
   
   This ensures backward compatibility while prioritizing the correct field names
   from the techregister form.

CURRENT PROFILE FIELDS DISPLAYED:
================================

1. **Basic Information:**
   - Name (technician.name)
   - Specialization (technician.specialization)
   
2. **Location & Experience:**
   - Location (government + district, or fallback)
